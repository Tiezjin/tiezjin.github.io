## My small Project on Historical Font

# Enea Silvio Piccolomini's Autograph in the 1440s
## The Digital Font of a Humanistic Script based on Manuscript BAV. Chig. H IV 135 ##


## Context
<p>Our modern world is to a large extent standarlized, when it comes to letters and words.
Everyday we read the texts rendered by the computer almost with the same fonts. We express and type our thoughts on the digital screen also with those same fonts. </p>
<p>It is very convenient, but sometimes a bit boring.
In contrast, the medieval world is a diverse one.
Medieval people, if they were literate, read the texts created by the quill pen. And if they had the chance to write down their thoughts, they were happy to writing in their own hands with different scripts.</p>
<p>Since those scripts are very indivudalistic, is it very interesting to revive them in the digital world?</p>
<p>Inspired by this idea, I decide to work on this small project to transform those hand-written letters to the digital-stored bits. </p>

### Piccolomini's Autograph
<p>Enea Silvio Piccolomini 1405-1464, is a great humanist in the 15th century. As an imperial secretary, he might have contributed to the spread of the humanistic script in the imperial chancellery.
Thanks to the great study by Martin Wagendorfer, Die Schrift des Eneas Silvius Piccolomini, we can nowadays know with certainty that some manuscripts are written by Piccolomini's own hands.</p>
<p>The Manuscript BAV. Chig. H IV 135 is written in humanistic script and thought to be written by Piccolomini in the 1440s.This manuscript is preserved in Rome and its digital version can be accessed online. Thus it is possible to create an autograph of this great humanist.</p>

### Download Link
<p>The font is made by open source software [Fontforge](https://fontforge.org/en-US/).
This is a temporal product, since there are some letters like W, K and Z, which have not be found in the manuscript and thus left empty.</p>
it can be downlaoded as humanistic script
